Feature: Dashboard
	In order to have an overview of the various user options
	As a registered Video Hearings administrator
	I want to be able to quickly access different screens within the application

Scenario: Video Hearings Officer Dashboard
	Given the Video Hearings Officer user has progressed to the Dashboard page
	Then there are various dashboard options available
	And they can navigate to the Open Government licence
